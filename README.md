# Kidron-Park-Remake
-Premise-

This project is a basic demonstration of how I've grown and improved over time. The goal of this project was to 
take an old website I made after high school and apply what I've learned since then from books, college and other 
sources like CodeAcademy. In short, how would I design the website differently knowing what I do now.

-Details-

The original website is: https://sites.google.com/site/kidroncommunitypark/ which I created around 2013 using google sites.
My experience at the time was a single project in high school (also using google sites) and unfortunately, the quality and 
design clearly reflects that. A lot has changed since then, especially the widespread use of smartphones and tablets 
which presents new requirements to improve design. As such, I feel that it provides a unique opportunity to 
examine both: how standards have changed over time and, how my understanding and experience have improved my work.

-Goals-

1. Ease of Use (Simple/Modern Design)
2. Adaptive/Responsive (Scaling and adjusting for screen size)
3. Better Appearance (Clean/Consistant)
4. General and Misc. improvements (Especially fixing the photo gallery)

-Results-

1. Eliminating the "Contact Us" page, the upcoming events box and the side navigation box were all good steps in improving 
and simplifying. There wasn't any reason to have a whole separate page just for contact information when there was plenty 
of room on the home page. Switching to a navigation bar, altering how images are handled and many other changes have all 
resulted in a more modern design that is simpler and intuitive to use.
2. With the use of the Flexbox moddel as well as @media calls, the new design responds to screen sizes by changing the 
layout of pages and sizes of elements.
3. Page appearance is more consistant and cleaner with screen responsiveness allowing the materials to be easily accessible 
without crowding while taking advantage of however much horizontal space there is.
4. The new photo gallery is a significant improvement over the jumbled mess it used to be. I debated the pros and cons 
of reusing the old pictures vs taking new ones. Using the old pictures would showcase how the same resources could be 
used in different ways but new pictures would look better. When I settled on the new gallery design (single images instead 
of rows of images), it became clear that the poor quality and resolution of the images wouldn't go well with the new design. 
While it took a bit more time and effort, the end result was significantly better.

-Conclusion-

It is clear that I have more to learn especially regarding how to handle wider screens without the content stretching too 
far and losing the clean appearance that is favored by modern design practices. It is also clear that I have made major strides
from my time with google sites. I really enjoyed working on this project and seeing just how far I've come. I'm happy with the 
results and I'll have to see about reaching out to the Park to see if they're interested in updating their site. 

Thank you for your time.


-Acknowledgements-
1. CodeAcademy taught me about the use of the Flexbox model which I used extensively for scaling. I frequently went back 
to review old projects and lessons to better use them.
2. Querries to W3Schools and the Mozilla Development Network also helped with troubleshooting and proper formatting.
3. Colormind.io is a fun tool I found which generates a color scheme based on an image that you upload. For this project, 
I uploaded the old Park_Path image. On the old website I used it (poorly) as a background image for each page. I still 
like it and wanted to make use of it again so this time I used it as the background for the Banner on each page. 
4. I used Github for code and file management and did the actual coding using the Atom code editor.
